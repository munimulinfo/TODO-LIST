# ToDo List App With React 

I’ve developed a to-do list app using React Context and Hooks. The tasks you add to the to-do list are saved on localStorage. So, even if you close the page, your task list will stored.

- You can mark the task you added as pending or complete.
- You can filter the tasks you marked.
- You can edit the tasks you have added.
- You can delete the tasks you have added.
